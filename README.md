# Diabetes_Type2
Abstract:
India is home to over 60 million adults with diabetes (7.8% of the population), of which more than 30 million are undiagnosed or untreated, 
thus increasing the risk of developing complications and premature mortality. 
Diabetes is a growing threat nowadays, one of the reasons being that there is no perfect cure for it. 
This project aims to make a Data Science Model to Predict Type-2 Diabetes.
Idea brief:
We will build a data science model to predict type-2 diabetes. It uses logistic regression to classify the diabetic outcomes of each person's record. 
The type-2 diabetes is commonly called diabetes mellitus. It can be defined as a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). We consider the mellitus here. After several researches we found that some parameters are directly responsible for the mellitus to occur. By using the data of the people with diabetes and without diabetes, a dataset will be  built. We further use that dataset to classify the people who are in the risk of getting diabetes. 

Intended Approach:
Loading the required libraries
Data Loading- The observations of people are stored in a file and that file is loaded in environment.
Correlations-The proportionalities of attributes of data that can be identified by correlation coefficient. This helps to know which attributes are highly dependent on prediction variable.  
Visualizations-To  graph the structure of data and its relations, as in how they vary and their relation with other data
Preparing the data- Dividing data into training data and testing data, by listing out the major factors, i,e direct proportionality.
Build models- Classify the concerned person with diabetes or not. 
Prediction- A trained model is used to predict the data and for training data.
ROC Curve- Receiver operating characterstic curve, graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied.
Comparison between models- Comparing real values with real data, we can check the performance of our application. 

Tech Stack:
Programming Language- Python(intermediate), R(basic)
Libraries- Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning- Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes Theorem and Gradient Boosting.
